Currently we have some basic JavaScript functions that can convert temperatures between Kelvin, Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Next, we'll need to create an HTML form for putting in the numbers and a drop down box for choosing what factors to convert to and from.

Last, a couple of simple CSS stylings.

And that will complete this app! A fully functioning Temperature Calculator to use whenever I need it :)

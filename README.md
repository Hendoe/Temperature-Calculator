Currently we have some basic JavaScript that can convert temperature from Kelvin into Celsius and then Fahrenheit.

With that finished, we'll need to create an HTML form for putting in the numbers and a drop down box for choosing what factors to convert to and from.

Last, a couple of simple CSS stylings.

And that will complete this app! A fully functioning Temperature Calculator to use whenever I need it :)
